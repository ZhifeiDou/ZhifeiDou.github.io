## Introduction
*(one-paragraph teaser; copy or paraphrase from Section 2 of the PDF)*

## Related Work
Brief bullet list—just enough to show readers.

## Methods
* Fine-tuned encoder-only LLMs (RoBERTa, DeBERTa…)  
* Post-hoc explainability (Saliency, LIME, Occlusion)  
* Prompt-based generative LLMs (Qwen, QwQ) with self-consistency & RAG

## Results
Include one or two key numbers/tables (you can recreate tiny tables in Markdown).

## Conclusion
Short takeaway and link again to the full PDF.
